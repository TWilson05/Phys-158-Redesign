A resistor ($R=6\units{\Omega}$) and a capacitor of unknown value are connected in series to a $12\units{V}$ battery at time $t=0$. The current through the resistor $0.1$ seconds after the battery is connected is measured to be $1\units{A}$.\\
A dielectric of unknown value $\kappa$ is then inserted in the capacitor. and the current through the resistor after $0.1$ seconds is measured to be $0.75\units{A}$.\\
What are the values of both the capacitor and the dielectric?
