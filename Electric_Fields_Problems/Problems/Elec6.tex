A resistor ($R=2\units{\Omega}$) and a capacitor ($C=16\units{\mu F}$) are connected in parallel to a $10\units{V}$ battery. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the current flowing through the resistor after a long period of time?
\end{enumerate}
At time $t=t_0$ a dielectric of $\kappa=4$ is inserted into the capacitor. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the new current flowing through the resistor at the instant the dielectric is inserted (at $t=t_0$)?
    \item What is the new current flowing through the resistor after a long time has passed?
\end{enumerate}
