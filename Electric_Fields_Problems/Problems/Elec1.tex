A $16\units{cm}$ long wire of charge $Q=40\units{\mu C}$ is bent into a square. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the electric field strength $20\units{cm}$ vertically above the center of the square.
\end{enumerate}
A point charge of mass $m=100\units{g}$ and charge $5\units{\mu C}$ is now placed $20\units{cm}$ above the center of the square.
\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{1}
    \item Find the magnitude and direction of the force acting on the point charge initially.
    \item Plot the acceleration of the point charge as a function of it's height above the center of the square.
\end{enumerate}
