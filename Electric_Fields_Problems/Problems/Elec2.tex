An insulating cylinder of radius $R=5\units{cm}$ and effectively infinite length contains a uniform charge density of $10\units{C/m^3}$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the electric field everywhere in space
\end{enumerate}
If there is now a hollow spherical cavity of radius $r=1\units{cm}$ located at the center of the cylinder,

\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{1}
    \item Find the electric field at the center of the sphere at point A.
    \item Find the electric field just outside the sphere at point B.
    \item Find the electric field just outside the sphere at point C.
    \item If $h=10\units{cm}$, find the electric field outside both objects at point D.
\end{enumerate}
If the potential at the point $E$ is 0V,
\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{5}
    \item What is the potential at point A?
\end{enumerate}
