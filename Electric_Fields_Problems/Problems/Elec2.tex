An insulating sphere of radius $5\units{m}$ contains a uniform charge density of $10\units{C/m^3}$. A hole of radius $1\units{m}$ is drilled all the way through the sphere.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the electric field at the center of the sphere
    \item Find the potential at the center of the sphere
    \item Find the electric field at a point $6\units{m}$ away from the sphere, directly above where the hole was drilled.
    \item How might you compute the electric field at any point inside the object?
\end{enumerate}
