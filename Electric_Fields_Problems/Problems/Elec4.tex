A rectangular box has dimensions 2m by 4m by 8m. At each corner of the box sits a point charge of value $Q$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the electric field at the center of the box?
    \item What is the potential at the center of the box?
    \item What is the total energy of the system?
\end{enumerate}
One of the point charges on the corners is removed.
\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{3}
    \item What is the new electric field at the center of the box?
    \item What is the new potential at the center of the box?
    \item What is the work done on the system in removing that point charge?
    \item What is the new total energy of the system?
\end{enumerate}
