A coil with $L= 88\units{mH}$ and unknown resistance, and a capacitor ($C = 0.94 \units{\mu F}$) are connected in series with an
alternating EMF operating at a frequency$ = 930 \units{Hz}$. If the phase constant between the applied voltage and the
current is $+75^\circ$, what is the resistance $R$ of the coil?
