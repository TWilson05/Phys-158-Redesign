Consider two solid spheres of radius $R$ with uniformly distributed charge
throughout their volumes. Point $P$ lies on the line connecting the centres of
the spheres and is located at a distance of $0.5R$ from the centre of sphere
1 as shown. If the net electric field at $P$ is zero, what is the ratio $Q_2 /Q_1$ of the
total charge on each sphere?
