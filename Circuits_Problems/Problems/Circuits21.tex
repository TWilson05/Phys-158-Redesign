An AC circuit is hooked up in series with a resistor $R = 50\units{\Omega}$, capacitor
$C = 10\units{\mu F}$, and inductor $L = 5\units{H}$. The RMS voltage is $35.36\units{V}$ with frequency
$127.3\units{Hz}$. At time $t = 0$, the current through the resistor is at a maximum.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the max charge of the capacitor
    At time $t = 5\units{s}$ the voltage source is removed from the circuit, creating an RLC
    circuit.
    \item Find the voltage through the inductor at $t = 10\units{s}$
\end{enumerate}
