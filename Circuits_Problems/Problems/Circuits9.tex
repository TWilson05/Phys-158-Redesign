% HW2 Q3
A light bulb is connected in the circuit shown below -- the switch S is initially open and the
capacitor is is uncharged. The battery has no appreciable internal resistance and a voltage = $12\units{V}$. The
resistance of the light bulb is $1000 \units{\Omega}$, $R = 50\units{\Omega}$ and $C = 100\units{\mu F}$ . The switch is closed at $t=0$.\\

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the all of the currents at $t=0^+$.
    \item Find all of the currents after a very long time.
    \item Find the current in the bulb as a function of time.
    \item Sketch the brightness of the bulb as a function of time.
