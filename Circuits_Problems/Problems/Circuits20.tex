\subsection*{Problem 20}
An LC circuit is constructed in series with a $12\units{V}$ battery, capacitor $C = 5\units{\mu F}$, and
inductor $L = 0.5\units{H}$. Find:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The initial energy in the circuit
    \item The max current in the circuit
    \item How often the capacitor attains a max charge in 12.2 seconds
    \item How much power is dissipated in the circuit after 40 seconds
\end{enumerate}
