\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the potential from $a$ to $b$ when the switch S is open.
    \item Find the final charge on the two capacitors.
\end{enumerate}
The switch is now closed
\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{2}
    \item After a long time calculate the final charge on the capacitors.
    \item How much charge flows through the switch in 300 seconds?
\end{enumerate}
