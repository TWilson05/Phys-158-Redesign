Each of the two $25\units{\mu F}$ capacitors shown is initially
uncharged. How many coulombs of charge pass
through the ammeter A after the switch S is
closed?\\

\textbf{Solution:}\\
When the switch is closed the two
capacitors and power supply are
all at 4000V.\\
The charge on each capacitor is $q=CV$ which in this case is
\[q=(25\units{\mu F})(4000\units{V})=0.1\units{C}\]
for each capacitor so a total of $\answer{0.2\units{C}}$ flows through the ammeter
