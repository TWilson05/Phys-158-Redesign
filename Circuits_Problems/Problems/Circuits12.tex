\subsection*{Problem 12}
% HW2 Q6
The circuit shown below initially has no charge on the capacitors and the switch S is
originally open. Use $R_1 = 4\units{\Omega}$, $R_3 = 8\units{\Omega}$, $R_4 = 8\units{\Omega}$, $R_5 = 6\units{\Omega}$ $C_1 =2\units{\mu F}$, and $C_2 = 6\units{\mu F}$.\\

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Just after closing the switch S, find the currents $I_1$, $I_2$, $I_3$, $I_4$, $I_5$.
    \item After the switch has been closed for a very long time, find the currents $I_1$, $I_2$, $I_3$, $I_4$, $I_5$.
    \item After the switch S has been closed for a very long time, find the potential at points A, B, C, D, E, \& F.
\end{enumerate}
(Note that the directions of the arrows don't necessarily mean that the current will be flowing in that direction.)
