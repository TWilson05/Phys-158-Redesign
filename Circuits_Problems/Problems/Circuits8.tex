\begin{enumerate}
    \item Just after closing the switch S, find all the currents.
    \item After the switch has been closed for a very long time,
    find all the currents.
    \item After the switch S has been closed for a very long time,
    find the potential difference across the $28.0\units{\mu F}$ capacitor.
