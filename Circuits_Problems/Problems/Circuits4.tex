\subsection*{Problem 4}
The circuit below has the switch S is opened for a long time. $R_1=2\units{\Omega},\ R_2=4\units{\Omega},\ C=2\units{F}$\\

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The switch S is now closed. Find all currents just after the switch is closed.
    \item Find all currents after the switch has been closed for a very long time.
    \item After the switch was closed for a very long time it is opened again find the current
    through $R_2$ as a function of time.
\end{enumerate}
