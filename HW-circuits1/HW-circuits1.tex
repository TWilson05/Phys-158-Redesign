\maketitle

Aim for this homework is to cover the following topics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introductory resistor circuits problems that can be used as a review for students who have not seen them in high school (aim for 1 problem)
    \item Analyzing circuits with capacitors, inductors, and switches in initial states and after long periods of time (aim for 2-3 problems)
    \item Analyzing RC and RL circuits and time constants (aim for 2-3 problems)
\end{itemize}

Review topics/guides to include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can include a document and optional MP homework assignment that introduces students to the concept of circuits if they haven't seen them before
\end{itemize}

Thoughts and ideas:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Could do a coding question for an RLC circuit using python
\end{itemize}
